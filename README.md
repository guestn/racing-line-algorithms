# racing-line-algorithms

Investigate possible solutions to find shortest/fastest racing line of a procedurally-generated racetrack in 3D

* Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm without backwards tracing
* Spline-based iterative method with parameters for shortest path vs curvature

In the project directory, run:

`yarn startdev`
